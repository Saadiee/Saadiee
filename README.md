# Saad Ur Rehman 👋

Aspiring **Cybersecurity Engineer** with a strong backend and systems foundation 🛡️  
I focus on understanding how systems fail, how attacks surface in data, and how to detect them reliably.

## 🎯 Focus
- Cybersecurity engineering (purple-team oriented)
- Backend services and APIs
- Security monitoring, logs, and event analysis
- Building tools that prioritize correctness and clarity

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Languages**
- Python 🐍  
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- SQL  
- C (learning)  
- Rust (learning) 🦀
- Go (learning) 

**Backend & Systems**
- RESTful APIs  
- Authentication / authorization concepts  
- Linux & networking fundamentals  
- Logging and basic observability  

**Security**
- Web security fundamentals  
- Blue-team concepts  
- Detection and incident-thinking mindset  
- CompTIA Security+ (in progress) 🛡️  

## 📂 Repositories
You’ll mostly find:
- Security-focused experiments  
- Backend projects with a systems mindset  
- Learning repos with incremental, practical improvements  

Projects here are built to understand **how things work and how they break**, not to chase polish.

## 🧭 Direction
Working toward roles involving:
- Cybersecurity engineering  
- Security monitoring and detection  
- Backend systems that support security tooling
